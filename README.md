# Python OpenTelemetry Test

This is just a python test script (test.py) that runs a submodule, and then sends the data to Honeycomb or an OTEL collector or something.

I'm using this as an example of implementing tracing between a parent application and its submodules.  This is not meant to be something you can copy-paste into your code by any means, and is really just a playground repo for me that I push to periodically so that I can recover it in the future if needed.
